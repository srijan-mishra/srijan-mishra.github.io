                I am a 2014 graduate from <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>. I have done my schooling from Bhopal, a small beautiful city in central India which boasts 7 lakes and 7 hills. Currently I am based out of New Delhi, India working as a Software Engineer at a two wheeler taxi aggregator startup, <a href="http://www.baxi.taxi/">Baxi- The Bike Taxi</a>.
            </p>

                Although my bachelors was in Mechanical Engineering, I was always intrigued by the power of Mathematics and how it can magically explain and solve every problem in the world. Reading up more on applied maths got me excited to learn and work towards the form of applied maths that is perhaps at its culmination of problem solving- Computer Science. Out of the wide variety of problems that Computer Scientists are out to solve, the problem of making machines intelligent and teaching themselves to grow excites me the most.
            </p>

                To further my learning in the subject of Machine Learning, I took up a wide variety of courses on the subject and started working on some real life problems. I started applying Machine Learning on two problems of Computer Vision. The first one is for the Assitech Lab, IIT Delhi. At Assistech, we are working towards developing a mobility assistant for blind people that would provide them real-time instructions on the scenario in front of them using Image-Processing, Computer Vision and NLP techniques. I am working on the critical aspect of removing shadows from images, which cause serious troubles in other feature detection algorithms. More can be found about it <a href="https://github.com/srijan-mishra/Shadow-Removal">here</a>. The second problem that I am working on is a Fine-Grained Leaf Classification problem under Professor Arnav Bhavsar, IIT Mandi. Here I am working on the <a href="http://leafsnap.com/">Leafsnap Dataset</a> towards developing a model that could classify leaf species with high accuracies. More can be found about it <a href="https://github.com/srijan-mishra/Computer-Vision-Projects/tree/master/Projects/Leaf-Classification">here</a>. A complete list of projects can be found <a href="projects.html">here</a>.

                On the lighter side, I am a photography enthusiast-have a look at my album <a href="https://www.facebook.com/srijanmishra/media_set?set=a.201037569951608.63626.100001360991032&type=3">here</a>. I love travelling to places that get me closer to nature. I also like watching suspense/thriller movies and TV shows and like listening to slow rock songs. I like working-out and make sure that I spend an hour a day doing the same. Lost 22 kgs in 3 months(Oh yeah!) initially in 2016.
